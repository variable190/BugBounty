# Login Brute Forcing Cheat Sheet

## What is Brute Forcing?
A trial-and-error method used to crack passwords, login credentials, or encryption keys by systematically trying every possible combination of characters.

## Factors Influencing Brute Force Attacks
- Complexity of the password or key
- Computational power available to the attacker
- Security measures in place

## How Brute Forcing Works
1. Start: The attacker initiates the brute force process.
2. Generate Possible Combination: The software generates a potential password or key combination.
3. Apply Combination: The generated combination is attempted against the target system.
4. Check if Successful: The system evaluates the attempted combination.
5. Access Granted (if successful): The attacker gains unauthorized access.
6. End (if unsuccessful): The process repeats until the correct combination is found or the attacker gives up.

## Types of Brute Forcing
| Attack Type | Description | Best Used When |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Simple Brute Force | Tries every possible character combination in a set (e.g., lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols). | When there is no prior information about the password. |
| Dictionary Attack | Uses a pre-compiled list of common passwords. | When the password is likely weak or follows common patterns. |
| Hybrid Attack | Combines brute force and dictionary attacks, adding numbers or symbols to dictionary words. | When the target uses slightly modified versions of common passwords. |
| Credential Stuffing | Uses leaked credentials from other breaches to access different services where users may have reused passwords. | When you have a set of leaked credentials, and the target may reuse passwords. |
| Password Spraying | Attempts common passwords across many accounts to avoid detection. | When account lockout policies are in place. |
| Rainbow Table Attack | Uses precomputed tables of password hashes to reverse them into plaintext passwords. | When a large number of password hashes need cracking, and storage for tables is available. |
| Reverse Brute Force | Targets a known password against multiple usernames. | When there’s a suspicion of password reuse across multiple accounts. |
| Distributed Brute Force | Distributes brute force attempts across multiple machines to speed up the process. | When the password is highly complex, and a single machine isn't powerful enough. |

| ssh | Secure Shell (SSH). Targets SSH services to brute-force credentials, commonly used for secure remote login to systems. | `hydra -l root -P /path/to/password_list.txt ssh://192.168.1.100` |
| http-get/post | HTTP Web Services. Used to brute-force login credentials for HTTP web login forms using either GET or POST requests. | `hydra -l admin -P /path/to/password_list.txt 127.0.0.1 http-post-form "/login.php:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:F=incorrect"` |

### Medusa
Fast, massively parallel, modular login brute-forcer. Supports a wide array of services.
```bash
medusa [-h host|-H file] [-u username|-U file] [-p password|-P file] [-C file] -M module [OPT]
```

#### Medusa Module
| Module | Service/Protocol | Description | Example Command |

| http-get | HTTP Web Services | Brute force HTTP Basic Authentication. | `medusa -h www.example.com -U users.txt -P passwords.txt -M http -m GET` |
| ssh | Secure Shell (SSH) | Stop after the first valid SSH login is found. | `medusa -h 192.168.1.100 -u admin -P passwords.txt -M ssh -f` |

## Custom Wordlists
### Username Anarchy
Generates potential usernames based on a target's name.
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `username-anarchy Jane Smith` | Generate possible usernames for "Jane Smith" |
| `username-anarchy -i names.txt` | Use a file (names.txt) with names for input. Can handle space, CSV, or TAB delimited names. |
| `username-anarchy -a --country us` | Automatically generate usernames using common names from the US dataset. |
| `username-anarchy -l` | List available username format plugins. |
| `username-anarchy -f format1,format2` | Use specific format plugins for username generation (comma-separated). |
| `username-anarchy -@ example.com` | Append @example.com as a suffix to each username. |
| `username-anarchy --case-insensitive` | Generate usernames in case-insensitive (lowercase) format. |

### CUPP (Common User Passwords Profiler)
Creates personalized password wordlists based on gathered intelligence.
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cupp -i` | Generate wordlist based on personal information (interactive mode). |
| `cupp -w profiles.txt` | Generate a wordlist from a predefined profile file. |
| `cupp -l` | Download popular password lists like rockyou.txt. |

## Password Policy Filtering
Password policies often dictate specific requirements for password strength, such as minimum length, inclusion of certain character types, or exclusion of common patterns. grep combined with regular expressions can filter wordlists to identify passwords that adhere to a given policy.

### Policy Requirements and Grep Regex Patterns
| Policy Requirement | Grep Regex Pattern | Explanation |
|-------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Minimum Length (e.g., 8 characters) | `grep -E '^.{8,}$' wordlist.txt` | `^` matches the start of the line, `.` matches any character, `{8,}` matches 8 or more occurrences, `$` matches the end of the line. |
| At Least One Uppercase Letter | `grep -E '[A-Z]' wordlist.txt` | `[A-Z]` matches any uppercase letter. |
| At Least One Lowercase Letter | `grep -E '[a-z]' wordlist.txt` | `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter. |
| At Least One Digit | `grep -E '[0-9]' wordlist.txt` | `[0-9]` matches any digit. |
| At Least One Special Character | `grep -E '[!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{};':"\,.<>/?]' wordlist.txt` | `[!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{};':"\,.<>/?]` matches any special character (symbol). |
| No Consecutive Repeated Characters | `grep -E '(.)\1' wordlist.txt` | `(.)` captures any character, `\1` matches the previously captured character. This pattern will match any line with consecutive repeated characters. Use `grep -v` to invert the match. |
| Exclude Common Patterns (e.g., "password") | `grep -v -i 'password' wordlist.txt` | `-v` inverts the match, `-i` makes the search case-insensitive. This pattern will exclude any line containing "password" (or "Password", "PASSWORD", etc.). |
| Exclude Dictionary Words | `grep -v -f dictionary.txt wordlist.txt` | `-f` reads patterns from a file. `dictionary.txt` should contain a list of common dictionary words, one per line. |
| Combination of Requirements | `grep -E '^.{8,}$' wordlist.txt | grep -E '[A-Z]'` | Filters a wordlist to meet multiple password policy requirements. Ensures each word has a minimum length of 8 characters and contains at least one uppercase letter. |
